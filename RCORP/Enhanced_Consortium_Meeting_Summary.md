**Strategic Review of the Substance Use Consortium**
**Date:** September 30, 2024
**Facilitators:** MDC - Hetal, Dianna, Megan
**Attendees:** Valerie, Jordan, Dr. Jackie, Niki, Bart, Makalya, Latasha, Janae, Shirley, Dr. Revels

**1. Executive Summary:**
This meeting was a strategic review of the substance use consortium, focusing on its history, successes, challenges, and future direction. The discussion, led primarily by Valerie, traced the consortium's significant growth from a small, grant-funded group of four entities in 2019 to a large coalition of over 70 agencies. 

Key successes celebrated include high member engagement, impactful training events like "March's Madness," progress in addressing stigma through recovery-oriented language initiatives, and a tangible contribution to overdose reduction. Major infrastructure wins include the Ron Barnes Center with 77 beds (currently at 60 beds with hopes to reach full capacity by end of year), opening in July, and improved relationships with the county. The consortium has also facilitated resource and data sharing, provided support for grant writing, and explored innovative solutions like Uber Health for transportation barriers.

However, the group identified persistent challenges including inadequate quality mental health treatment for co-occurring disorders, Medicaid limitations, funding competition between the county and consortium, and the county's rejection of a combined proposal. Getting key stakeholders to the table remains difficult, particularly EMS, elected officials, faith-based organizations, and the health department. The primary strategic imperative identified is the need to evolve the consortium's vision beyond simply meeting grant deliverables, with consideration of establishing a 501(c)(3) status for the consortium.

**2. Key Action Items/Commitments:**
- **Consortium Leadership:** Explore 501(c)(3) status for the consortium through NC Center for Nonprofits
- **Valerie:** Reach out to local hospital contact to encourage participation
- **Group:** Develop collaborative grant proposals around initiatives showing prevention funding utilization
- **Group:** Consider shared staffing models for sustainability

  - Difficulty getting key stakeholders to the table (EMS, elected officials, faith-based organizations)
  - Health department engagement remains limited
  - Overall engagement showing signs of decline
  
  **Funding and Resources:**
  - General funding constraints
  - Competition between county and consortium for available funds

**Required Shifts:**
  - Move from volunteer-driven to more sustained staffing model
  - Goals beyond immediate priorities/treatment standards (12-MAT/SDOH)
  - Enhanced community counselor role and increased support
  - Meeting schedule optimization (consider if meetings should be combined)

**Program Strategy:**
  - Launch ongoing stigma reduction campaign
  - Focus on treatment and recovery initiatives beyond grant deliverables
  - Create incentive programs to boost participation
  - Strengthen role as central hub of information
  - "Regionalization of Robeson" - improve perception across counties while strengthening local foundation first ("work on our own house before we expand")
  
**Vision for Growth:**
  - Continue increasing membership with diverse representation
  - Enhance participation strategies moving members from passive to active roles
  - Develop member-driven vision independent of grant requirements
  - Consortium positioned as SDOH/social determinant solution hub for community
  - Focus on "Back to in-person" engagement to rebuild connections
  
- **Action Items/Commitments:**
  - **Consortium Leadership:** Develop long-term stigma campaign strategy
  - **Consortium Leadership:** Create participation incentive structure

  - **Group:** Design collaborative grant proposals for prevention, treatment, and recovery
  - **All Members:** Consider methods for encouraging active participation through rotating facilitation roles

### Topic 5: Member Engagement, Leadership Assessment, and Missing Stakeholders
- **Summary of Discussion:** 

**Leadership Team Evaluation:** The group assessed what's working well and what needs improvement:
- Working Well: Unity/shared vision, respect, expertise (particularly Valerie Bradshaw, Carolyn & Robinson, Trillium), diversity in representation
- Areas Needing Improvement: Need clearer information/decision-making flow between leadership team and organizations, better coordination around roles, more lived experience representation, law enforcement engagement

**Key Missing Stakeholders:**
- Primary gaps: Hospitals, RISE, community colleges
- Critical sectors: Law enforcement, EMS, services (law enforcement/treatment/EMS)
- Relationship gaps: Need more elected officials, faith-based organizations, public health representatives
- Communication gaps: Community members not fully aware of available resources, need more individuals with lived experience in core team roles

**Engagement Enhancement Ideas:**
- Full consortium voting on new initiatives  
- Rotating facilitation responsibilities among member agencies
- Better coordination between voice of OPPs and meetings
- More direct inclusion of people with lived experience (moved from bottom of agenda to more prominent positioning)
  
- **Action Items/Commitments:**
  - **Valerie:** Outreach to local hospital contact for consortium participation
  - **Consortium Leadership:** Implement member engagement strategies during meetings, including asking members to be part of agenda setting
