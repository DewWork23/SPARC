## REMAINING TASKS BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

### Critical (Must Do):
1. **Technical Testing:**
   - Open dashboard in browser
   - Test all tabs and interactions
   - Check console for errors
   - Test on mobile device
   - Test on multiple browsers

2. **Stakeholder Review:**
   - Share with county representatives
   - Get SPARC leadership approval
   - Address any concerns raised

### Recommended (Should Do):
1. Add more inline code comments for complex calculations
2. Test with fresh eyes (someone who hasn't seen it before)
3. Create a brief "How to Read This Dashboard" guide for users
4. Consider adding "Last Updated" timestamp visible on dashboard

### Optional (Nice to Have):
1. Link to source PDFs for transparency
2. Add glossary of terms
3. Add fiscal year selector for future multi-year data

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**Data Accuracy:** 🟢 **VERY HIGH** - All numbers verified against source documents

**Presentation Integrity:** 🟢 **VERY HIGH** - All misleading comparisons removed, context added

**Technical Functionality:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Not fully tested in browser environment

**Stakeholder Readiness:** 🔴 **LOW** - No external review yet

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Status:** Dashboard is **DATA-READY** but **NOT DEPLOYMENT-READY**

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ You can confidently review the data yourself
2. ⚠️ Before showing to others: Test technical functionality
3. ❌ Before going live: Get stakeholder sign-off

**The data is now trustworthy. The presentation is now honest. The remaining validation is about making sure it works properly and that stakeholders agree.**
