# COMPREHENSIVE SPARC DASHBOARD AUDIT REPORT

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Auditor:** Claude Code (AI Assistant)
**Audit Type:** Full systematic review of all dashboard content
**Severity Level:** üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND AND CORRECTED

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Finding
**The dashboard contained multiple instances of misleading data presentation that could have led to incorrect conclusions about county performance and resource allocation.** While the underlying source data was accurate, the way it was visualized and contextualized was problematic.

### Critical Issues Discovered: 6
### Issues Fixed: 6
### Current Status: ‚úÖ All known issues corrected

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: Misleading Cross-County Cost Comparisons
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Dashboard displayed "Cost Per Person" metrics that compared fundamentally different service models
- Cumberland: $262/person (broad recovery support services for 981 people)
- Bladen: $20,133/person (intensive residential treatment for 8 people)
- **This made Bladen appear 77x less efficient when they were providing completely different services**

**Misleading Implication:**
- Counties with low-intensity, high-volume services appeared "efficient"
- Counties with high-intensity, low-volume services appeared "wasteful"
- Could influence future funding decisions based on false efficiency metrics

**Action Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Removed `cost_per_person` field from county-narrative-data.json
- ‚úÖ Removed `efficiency_ranking` that ranked counties 1-5 based on this flawed metric
- ‚úÖ Added data quality notes explaining why these comparisons are inappropriate

**Files Modified:**
- county-narrative-data.json (lines removed, metadata added)

---

### Issue #2: Misleading "People Served" Comparisons
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Bar chart directly compared "people served" numbers across counties
- Each county was measuring completely different things:
  - Cumberland: 981 (anyone receiving any recovery support)
  - Robeson: 184 (hospital treatment placements only)
  - Columbus: 86 (residential admissions only)
  - Richmond: 30 (only people who completed program - excludes dropouts)
  - Bladen: 8 (treatment facility referrals)
  - Scotland: NULL (no programs operational)

**Misleading Implication:**
- Cumberland appeared to be serving 123x more people than Bladen
- Richmond's 100% success rates appeared superior (but excluded all failures)
- Bar chart suggested direct performance comparability when none exists

**Action Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced bar chart with contextual county cards
- ‚úÖ Each card now explains what the number actually represents
- ‚úÖ Added disclaimer: "These figures represent different service types and measurement methodologies"
- ‚úÖ Added service type labels (e.g., "Recovery Support Services", "Treatment Placements")

**Files Modified:**
- index.html (lines 817-913 - complete redesign of visualization)

---

### Issue #3: Incorrect Exhibit A/B Strategy Labels
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-10-21)

**Problem:**
- Detailed Spending Breakdown showed "(B)" after every strategy name
- Suggested all counties were using Exhibit B strategies
- **Actual reality:** Only Columbus uses primarily Exhibit B; all others use Exhibit A
- This misrepresented county compliance with settlement agreement terms

**Actual County Breakdown:**
- Cumberland: 100% Exhibit A strategies
- Robeson: 100% Exhibit A strategies (currently Option A participant)
- Columbus: 96% Exhibit B, 4% Exhibit A
- Richmond: 100% Exhibit A strategies
- Bladen: 100% Exhibit A strategies
- Scotland: 100% Exhibit A strategies

**Misleading Implication:**
- Made it appear all counties were using expanded Exhibit B strategies
- Could confuse stakeholders about county strategy choices
- Misrepresented Robeson's Option A status

**Action Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed code to use actual `strat_exhibit_letter` from row data
- ‚úÖ Now displays correct exhibit (A or B) in Category column
- ‚úÖ Removed redundant "(B)" from strategy names
- ‚úÖ Added contextual description explaining the difference

**Files Modified:**
- index.html (lines 1959-1975 - fixed exhibit letter display logic)
- index.html (lines 507-511 - added accurate contextual description)

---

### Issue #4: Mathematical Error in Percentages
**Severity:** üü° MODERATE
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Columbus County substance use percentages summed to 101%
- Opioids: 51% + Crack/Cocaine: 20% + Alcohol: 17% + Meth: 10% + Opioids/Benzos: 3% = 101%

**Action Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Adjusted Opioids from 51% to 50%
- ‚úÖ Percentages now sum to exactly 100%

**Files Modified:**
- county-narrative-data.json (Columbus.substance_use_breakdown.opioids)

---

### Issue #5: Survivorship Bias Not Labeled
**Severity:** üü° MODERATE
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Richmond County showed 100% success rates across multiple metrics
- Data represented only program completers (people who dropped out were excluded)
- This survivorship bias was not disclosed on the dashboard

**Action Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Added "Program completers only" label to Richmond data
- ‚úÖ Documented in metadata that 30 represents completers, not total enrolled
- ‚úÖ Added notes about survivorship bias

**Files Modified:**
- county-narrative-data.json (metadata section)

---

### Issue #6: Duplicate Cost/Person Column in Overview Tab
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-10-21)

**Problem:**
- During systematic review, discovered a SECOND instance of Cost/Person calculations
- Overview tab's "Regional Impact Summary" table had Cost/Person column (line 752)
- This was the SAME misleading comparison we thought we'd already fixed
- Issue was found only because of comprehensive tab-by-tab review

**Why This is Concerning:**
- Demonstrates how misleading metrics can hide in multiple places
- Even after "fixing" the issue, it persisted elsewhere
- Shows need for systematic validation, not spot fixes
- Highlights risk that other issues might exist in unchecked areas

**Action Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Removed Cost/Person column from Overview table
- ‚úÖ Added asterisk and disclaimer to "People Served" column
- ‚úÖ Improved number formatting for consistency
- ‚úÖ Added warning note about incomparable methodologies

**Files Modified:**
- index.html (lines 752-780 - removed column, added disclaimer)

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Did These Issues Occur?

1. **Lack of Data Literacy Context**
   - Dashboard builder assumed users would understand different service models
   - No explicit warnings about incomparability
   - Missing "apples to oranges" disclaimers

2. **Over-Aggregation**
   - Combining incompatible metrics into single visualizations
   - Treating all "people served" as equivalent
   - Missing granular context

3. **Technical Errors**
   - Code using wrong field for exhibit letters (lookup vs. actual row data)
   - Rounding errors not caught
   - Limited data validation

4. **Missing Metadata**
   - No source documentation initially
   - No methodology notes
   - No data quality indicators

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Remove all misleading comparison metrics
- ‚úÖ Add context to all county-specific data
- ‚úÖ Fix technical errors in data display
- ‚úÖ Add comprehensive metadata with sources
- ‚úÖ Document measurement methodologies

### Future Safeguards
- üî≤ Add "last updated" timestamp to dashboard
- üî≤ Include links to source PDFs
- üî≤ Create data quality checklist for updates
- üî≤ Add glossary of terms
- üî≤ Consider adding data quality indicators/flags

1. ‚úÖ Manual spot-check of spending data against Excel
2. ‚úÖ Verification of people served against PDFs
3. ‚úÖ Review of all comparative visualizations
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **User acceptance testing with county stakeholders**
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Peer review by data analyst**
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal/compliance review of claims made**

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Wrong
Data visualization without proper context can be more misleading than no visualization at all. Accurate source data presented incorrectly creates a false sense of authority.

### What Went Right
Issues were caught before widespread deployment. All source data was accurate and properly documented in underlying files.

### Going Forward
Every visualization needs explicit context. Every comparison needs validation that items are comparable. Every metric needs a definition visible to users.
