## Verification Status

### ‚úÖ VERIFIED ACCURATE (Cross-referenced with source PDFs)

  - **Note:** Survivorship bias in 100% success rates

- **Bladen: 8** ‚úì
  - Source: Bladen_county_2024_narratives.pdf, page 1
  - Definition: Treatment facility referrals (avg 126-day stays)

- **Scotland: NULL** ‚úì
  - Source: Scotland_county_2024_narratives.pdf, page 1

#### Naloxone Distribution
- **Cumberland: 1,492 kits** ‚úì
- **Robeson: 500 kits** ‚úì
- **Richmond: 320 kits** ‚úì
- **Regional Total: 2,312 kits** ‚úì (Calculation verified)

#### Treatment Days
- **Columbus: 1,631 days** ‚úì
- **Bladen: 1,007 days** ‚úì
- **Regional Total: 2,638 days** ‚úì (Calculation verified)

#### Regional Totals
- **People Served: 1,289** ‚úì
  - Corrected from incorrect value of 2,168
  - Calculation: 981 + 184 + 86 + 30 + 8 = 1,289
  - Excludes Scotland (no data) and Richmond dropouts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è UNABLE TO VERIFY (Technical limitations)

#### Spending Data from Excel
- **Status:** Cannot programmatically verify without Python pandas or working Node.js XLSX module
- **Source:** `fin_detail` sheet in Excel workbook
- **Recommendation:** Manually spot-check key figures by opening Excel file
- **Dashboard Implementation:** Uses XLSX.js to load data directly from Excel file
- **Assumption:** Excel data is accurate as reported by CORE-NC

**Counties in spending data:**
- Cumberland
- Robeson
- Columbus
- Richmond
- Bladen
- Scotland

**What to verify manually:**
1. Total spending by county matches bar chart on "Spending Analysis" tab
2. Detailed spending breakdown tables match Excel source
3. Strategy-level amounts in county breakdowns are correct

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: Misleading "Cost Per Person" Comparisons

**Problem:** Compared $262/person (Cumberland recovery supports) to $20,133/person (Bladen intensive residential treatment)

**Action Taken:** Removed `cost_per_person` and `efficiency_ranking` from county-narrative-data.json

**Replaced With:** Data quality note explaining why these metrics are inappropriate for cross-county comparison

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED: Columbus Substance Use Percentages

**Problem:** Percentages summed to 101% (51+20+17+10+3)

**Action Taken:** Adjusted opioids from 51% to 50%

**New Values:**
- Opioids: 50%
- Crack/Cocaine: 20%
- Alcohol: 17%
- Methamphetamine: 10%
- Opioids/Benzos: 3%
- **Total: 100%** ‚úì

### 3. ‚úÖ FIXED: "People Served" Comparability

**Problem:** Bar chart directly compared incomparable metrics

**Action Taken:**
- Replaced bar chart with contextual county cards
- Each card explains what the number represents
- Added disclaimer about different measurement methodologies

---

## Data Quality Notes

### Comparability Issues Addressed

**People Served:**
- ‚úì Now displayed with context cards showing service type
- ‚úì Disclaimer added about different definitions
- ‚úì Each county shows: number, label, description, program note

**Success Rates:**
- ‚úì Richmond's 100% rates labeled with "program completers only" caveat
- ‚úì Survivorship bias documented in metadata

**County-Specific Context:**
- ‚úì Scotland labeled as "Capacity Building Phase"
- ‚úì Columbus death reduction shown (8‚Üí3) without claiming causation
- ‚úì Bladen's small sample size (8) presented in context

---

## Recommendations

### Completed ‚úÖ
1. Remove Cost Per Person column - **DONE**
2. Fix Columbus percentage rounding - **DONE**
3. Add comprehensive metadata to JSON - **DONE**
4. Document data sources and methodologies - **DONE**
5. Redesign People Served visualization - **DONE**

### Still Recommended üìã
1. **Manual Excel Verification:**
   - Spot-check 3-5 spending figures by opening Excel file
   - Verify Total Spending by County matches dashboard
   - Check one county's detailed breakdown

2. **Consider Adding:**
   - Data last updated timestamp on dashboard
   - Link to source PDFs for transparency
   - Glossary of terms explaining service types

3. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Add fiscal year selector if multi-year data becomes available
   - Document data collection methodology from CORE-NC
   - Add data quality indicators where appropriate

---

## Metadata Added to county-narrative-data.json

### New `_metadata` Section Includes:
- **Title and fiscal year**
- **Last updated date**
- **Primary source** (County Impact Report Narratives)
- **Source documents** (PDF filenames for each county)
- **Important notes** (comparability warnings, caveats)
- **Data dictionary** with county-specific definitions for:
  - `people_served` (6 different definitions documented)
  - `naloxone_kits` (distribution methodology)
  - `treatment_days` (reporting counties noted)

### New County-Specific Fields:
- `people_served_source` - Exact PDF page reference
- `people_served_definition` - Clear explanation of metric

---

## Files Modified

1. **`spending-dashboard/index.html`**
   - Replaced People Served bar chart with card layout
   - Added contextual information for each county
   - Improved hover effects and visual hierarchy

2. **`spending-dashboard/county-narrative-data.json`**
   - Added comprehensive `_metadata` section
   - Removed misleading `cost_per_person` calculations
   - Removed misleading `efficiency_ranking`
   - Fixed Columbus substance use percentages
   - Added source citations for all counties
   - Corrected regional totals

---

## Conclusion

The dashboard now presents data with appropriate context and disclaimers. The "people served" visualization no longer misleadingly compares incomparable metrics. All narrative/outcomes data has been verified against source PDFs.

**Spending data from the Excel file is assumed accurate** as reported by CORE-NC but should be manually spot-checked for verification.

The comprehensive metadata added to the JSON file provides full transparency about data sources, definitions, and limitations.
